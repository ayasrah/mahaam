# Mahaam Functions

### Overview

App functions refer to **business and user needs**. Common names are: usecases, user stories, business requirements and functional requirements.

### Importance

Understanding the right business and user needs is the first and last step of app creation. Its a continous process before, during, and after app creation. Always ask yourself, does this feature serve business needs or users needs, if not, maybe its useless even though its smart.

### Steps

In Order to Model/Design/Get Functions of your app, Mahaam suggests to:

- Consult expert users
- Consult business domain experts
- Start with human mental models: How do users actually think about the domain.
- Design workflows, not features, focus on complete user journeys.
- Continuous validation with actual users
