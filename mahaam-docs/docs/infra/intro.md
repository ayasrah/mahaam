# Mahaam Infra

### Overview

Mahaam Infra is the utility classes used by the whole modules. Eg: `DB`, `Log`, `Config` utilities.

### Purpose

These utilities are not related to a module or even a domain. They are common and could be used across different domains.

I tried to keep the usage as simple as possible, eg: `Log.Info(...)`, `Rule.Required(...)`

### Topics:

- Exceptions
- Request Context
- Security
- Logging
- Validation
- Swagger
- Config
- Cache
- Monitor
