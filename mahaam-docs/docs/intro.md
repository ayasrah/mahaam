# Mahaam Introduction

### Overview

This documentation explains backend services concepts in the context of Mahaam.

### Philosophy

Maybe one language is better than another for a specific use case; however, these principles are what Mahaam cares about regardless of language or framework, and they are common throughout:

- Does the app meet **business and user** needs.
- Is the **app model** well designed.
- Is the codebase readable.
- Is the codebase **maintainable**.
- Avoid overengineering (more in Java/C# codebases).
- Avoid spaghetti code (more in Javascript codebases).

### Parts

1. **Service Setup**: App creation.
2. **Mahaam Design**: Functionality, data model, system design, and maintainability.
3. **Mahaam Module**: Module parts: Controller, Service and Repo.
