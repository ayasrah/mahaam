# Mahaam

### Overview

Mahaam is a production and opensourced TODO app built with 5 languages for backend: **`C#, Java, Go, Typescript and Python`**.

### Purpose

I started mahaam as a side project to **apply techs I learns on**. I tried Firebase, Firestore, Mongodb, and finally Postgres. For frontend, tried Flutter, for backend started by Java then C# then Go. Then, decided to open source the backend code, and take it one step further by adding Typescript and Python implementations.
