# Mahaam

### Overview

Mahaam is a proof-of-concept (POC) todo app for different technologies and frameworks. Currently it is implemented in **`C#, Java, Go, TypeScript, and Python`** and the app is live on app stores.

### Purpose

I created Mahaam to be a deeper proof-of-concept, making it useful for me and others. That's why I added more functions than typical todo apps and pushed it to production (app stores) to add real value.

### Philosophy

Mahaam is implemented across different languages with identical functionality. All versions expose the same API endpoints and connect to the same database schema.

Maybe one language is better than another for a specific use case; however, these principles are what Mahaam cares about regardless of language or framework, and they are common throughout:

- Does the app meet **business and user** needs?
- Is the **app data model** well designed?
- Is the codebase **readable and maintainable**?

### Mahaam.dev
