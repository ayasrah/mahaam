# Mahaam

### Overview

Mahaam is a production and opensourced TODO app built with 5 languages for backend: **`C#, Java, Go, Typescript and Python`**.

### Purpose

I started mahaam as a side project to **apply techs I learns on**. I tried Firebase, Firestore, Mongodb, and finally Postgres. For frontend, tried Flutter, for backend started by Java then C# then Go. Then, decided to open source the backend code, and take it one step further by adding Typescript and Python implementations.

### Mahaam.dev

I used to be a one language developer for a long time. After some struggles, I learned the hard way that there are things much more important than the language, and these are some:

- Understanding business and user needs.
- Good data model and UX design.
- Maintainable codebase.
- Avoiding overengineering and spagitti coding.

These are topics that I tried to address using Mahaam app regardless the language being used. And for that reason I created [mahaam.dev](https://mahaam.dev).

I’m not saying language doesn’t matter at all, each language shines in its use case and I still prefer some more than others, however, it does not matter a lot for me to work on any language as long as the readability and maintainability are priorities.
